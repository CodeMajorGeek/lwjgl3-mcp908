# lwjgl3-mcp908
LWJGL3 binding for MCP908

This is a prototype of an MCP908 (minecraft coder pack for 1.7.10 minecraft version) with an LWJGL 3 binding.

To use this repo as a base of an 1.7.10 minecraft mcp you have just to open Eclipse IDE in 'eclipse' folder, this mcp is already decompiled.

This mcp is not usable now, the input classes is'nt operationnal and the sound engine is broken. A little bit of code and all this project is going to work fine, I have already change all OpenGL code to work with latest LWJGL 3 libraries, the display with GLFW is good too.
